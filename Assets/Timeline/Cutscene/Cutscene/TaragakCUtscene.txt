Zulfikar the goose walked slowly, deep in thought. He had just been kicked out of his office job. Life wasn’t looking too great. He had seven little goslings to take care of and his wife was super angry because the rent hadn’t been paid for three months.

"I want a divorce!" she yelled, leaving with all the kids.

Now, Zulfikar was alone, broke, and depressed.

Just as he was about to sit down and honk his sorrows away, a mysterious paper flew into his beak. It was a job ad:

“Wanted: Chicken Farmer. Urgent!”

With nothing to lose, Zulfikar went to the farm.

But there was a tiny catch…

The baby chicks on the farm only ate one thing: Nasi Padang.

Zulfikar's new job?
Feeding spoiled chickens with Nasi Padang?!? every day.

The weirdest job ever had just begun.
